I would not recommend it for a fellow student for experimentation because the setup time is long and includes a lot of foreign topics (like cloud computing, security, networking) which requires even more time to research. Furthermore, you have to pay for the cloud usage (at least for Azure). I would instead recommend installing SQL Server on your computer, since the Developer version is free to use, and get their hands on learning SQL.

I would recommend using it for co-workers in corporations because cloud-based apps in general are easier to maintain and collaborate with, since everything is stored in a data center and not a local computer. For projects, cloud-based databases often offer lots of data storage and they don't have to worry about running out of storage unlike putting a database into a local machine.
